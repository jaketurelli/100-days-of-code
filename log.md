# 100 Days Of Code - Log

notes on Ruby

1. indices start at 0
2. Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because they're immutable and only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory

**Today's Progress**: Completed Control Flow, Looping, Array and Hashes. 1.5 hours. 

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I feel about looping in Ruby - it seems very convoluted, but I'm keeping an open mind. I like the language and the high level programming. I'm excited to get into the more complex data structures.
