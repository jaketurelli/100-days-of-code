### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on Ruby in the morning and on my website. 1 hour

**Thoughts:** CSS and HTML are not my favorite. I don't really like front-end coding. I'd like to get good at them and change this perspective. I think building my website will be a good opportunity for this.
