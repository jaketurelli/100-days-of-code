# 100 Days Of Code - Log

notes on Ruby

1. indices start at 0
2. Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because they're immutable and only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory
3. <% %> will evaluate the code, but will not print the output.
   <%= %> will evaluate the code AND print the output.
4. [Security](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)

### Day 18: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the blog RoR getting started tutorial. 1 hour.

**Thoughts:** The delete functionalities for comments and articles do not work. I'd like to fix these and understand why they aren't working before moving forward. There are a lot of good references at the end of this tutorial (listed in the notes above). I want to take some time read through these and get a feel for navigating Ruby on Rail resources before starting the next RoR project.

### Day 17: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to 7.2 Rendering a Partial Form. 1 hour.

**Thoughts:** Pretty complex stuff and the tutorial is a bit hard to follow as I think ruby on rails has changed a bit since this tutorial was released. Things don't quite match up exactly so I've had to modify some things. I don't mind though, and when things go wrong, it forces me to learn more. Good stuff.

### Day 16: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 5 Getting Up and Running. 1 hour.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't get the delete functionality working. My javascript isn't being called properly. I moved on. I'll figure this out later.

### Day 15: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it to 5.10 Adding Some Validation in the blog example at rubyonrails.org. .5 hour

### Day 14: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it to 5.5 Running a Migration in the blog example at rubyonrails.org. 1.5 hour

**Thoughts:** This walk through for the blog example is amazing. I'm learning all the basics of how to build a website with Ruby on Rails. Simple searching allowed me to get unstuck when running on windows becomes an issue.

### Day 13: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded Ruby on the laptop. Began working through the 'blog' guide at rubyonrails.org. 1.5 hour

**Thoughts:** I didn't like codecademy's tutorials were very good for ruby on rails. I tried out rubyonrails.org and their guides seem to be much better. I have run into a couple issues running through the tutorials (this may be because it is geared towards MAC). It seems that the issues I have had can be solved by simple searches. I will continue with guides running from my own machines rather than working through codecademy.

### Day 12: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began Ruby on Rails Course. 1.5 hour

**Thoughts:** Seems like a lot of this will require PRO updgrade. The basics is here though. I might need to migrate to a different resource for getting more practice.

### Day 11: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the entire codecademy Ruby course. 1.5 hour

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on Ruby in the morning and on my website. 1 hour
