# 100 Days Of Code - Log

notes on Ruby

1. indices start at 0
2. Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because they're immutable and only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory

**Thoughts:** Seems like a lot of this will require PRO updgrade. The basics is here though. I might need to migrate to a different resource for getting more practice.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on Ruby in the morning and on my website. 1 hour
